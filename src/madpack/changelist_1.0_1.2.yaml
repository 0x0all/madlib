# Changelist for MADlib version 1.0 to 1.2

# This file contains all changes that were introduced in a new version of
# MADlib. This changelist is used by the upgrade script to detect what objects
# should be upgraded (while retaining all other objects from the previous version)

# New modules (actually .sql_in files) added in upgrade version
# For these files the sql_in code is retained as is with the functions in the
# file installed on the upgrade version. All other files (that don't have
# updates), are cleaned up to remove object replacements

# Changes in the types (UDT) including removal and modification
udt:

# List of the UDF changes that affect the user externally.  This includes change
# in function name, change in argument order or argument types, and removal of
# the function. In each case, the original function is as good as removed and a
# new function is created. In such cases, we should abort the upgrade if there
# are user views dependent on this function, since the original function will
# not be present in the upgraded version.
