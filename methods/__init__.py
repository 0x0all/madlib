Many database systems already support some statistical functions. MADlib is an open source project which provides a common set of advanced mathematical, statistical and machine learning functions to several data processing systems. The platform choice for the initial version is PostgreSQL and Greenplum, but the plan is to add support for other RDBMS and data processing systems (e.g. MySQL, Hadoop or commercial data processing systems).
