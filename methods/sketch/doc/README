"Sketches" or "synopsis data structures" are small data objects that
summarize a column from a large table.  These small objects can be 
computed as user-defined aggs (or materialized views).  Then, 
scalar functions can be computed over them to extract information about
the column they summarize.

Currently we have implemented:
- Flajolet-Martin sketches for COUNT DISTINCT estimation.
- CountMin sketches for approximating:
	- COUNT of tuples with a given value
	- range-count of tuples in a range of values
	- centiles of a column (including median)
	- histograms, both equi-width and equi-depth
	- most frequent values
