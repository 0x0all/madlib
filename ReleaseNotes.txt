MADlib v0.2.1beta

   Release Date: 2011-Sep-14

   General changes:
    * numerous improvements to the C++ abstraction layer:
        - code clean-up
        - fixed issue where incorrect values were returned when used with
          debug builds of PostgreSQL/Greenplum (MADLIB-253)
        - fixed issue where returning arrays to PostgreSQL/Greenplum could lead
          to a crash (MADLIB-250)
        - allocated memory is now 16-byte aligned for improved stability and
          performance (MADLIB-236)
    * compiling with advanced warnings enabled by default now
    * all C/C++ code now free of warnings. On gcc <= 4.6, there might still be
      warnings due to "unclean" macros in DBMS header files (MADLIB-228)
    * prepared Solaris support in a later release (MADLIB-204)
        - added support for Sun Compiler in CMake build script
        - fixed all compilation errors with Sun compiler
    * added UDF to mimic "CREATE TABLE AS ...", as a workaround for a Greenplum 
      issue (MADLIB-241). Included this as GP Compatibility module.
    * madpack utility:
        - dropped madpack dependency on PygreSQL (MADLIB-217)
        - improved security in madpack install-check (MADLIB-229)
        - fixed bashism in madpack (MADLIB-222) 
        - fixed install-check not running on non-default schema (MADLIB-251)
            
   Modules/methods:
    * SVM (kernel_machines):
        - fixed cumulative error count in svm_cls_update() function
        - improved memory management in SVM module
    * Linear regression (regress):
        - fixed unexpected behavior for some edge cases (MADLIB-214)
        - fixed crashing with huge number of independent vars (MADLIB-250) 
    * Logistic regression (regress):
        - added support for arbitrary expressions for dep./indep. variables, not
          just column names (MADLIB-255)
    * Quantile:
        - fixed quantile() function to be exact
        - added simple version for small data sets
    * Sparse Vectors:
        - added check for sorted dictionary to svec_sfv (MADLIB-187)
    * Decision Tree (decision_tree):
        - now can be run multiple times in one session (MADLIB-156)
       
   Known issues:
    * non-unified API for several SQL UDFs (MADLIB-208)
    * performance of the conjugate-gradient optimizer in logistic regression 
      can be very poor (MADLIB-164)

   Release Date: 2011-Jul-8

   General changes:
    * new build and installation framework based on CMake
    * new C++ abstraction layer for easy and secure method development
    * new database installation utility (madpack)
    
   Modules/methods:
    * new: Association Rules (assoc_rules)
    * new: Array Operators (array_ops)
    * new: Decision Tree (decision_tree)
    * new: Conjugate Gradient (conjugate_gradient)
    * new: Parallel LDA	(plda)
    * improved: all methods from previous release
   
   Known issues:
    * non-unified API for several SQL UDFs (MADLIB-208)
    * running decision tree more than once in one session fails (MADLIB-156)
    * performance of the conjugate-gradient optimizer in logistic regression 
      can be very poor (MADLIB-164)
    * svec_sfv function doesn't check for sorted dictionary (MADLIB-187)
